This folder contains the implementation for the **Product Preview Page** challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io), designed to showcase product details dynamically, with responsive images and engaging UI interactions.

## Technologies & Tools

- **React:**  
  Used for building the component-based structure and interactive elements.

- **TypeScript:**  
  Ensures type safety and improves development speed by catching errors early.

- **Material-UI:**  
  Utilized for modern, accessible UI components like:
  - **Grid:**  
    For creating a responsive layout.
  - **Skeleton:**  
    For rendering loading placeholders during content load.
  - **Modal:**  
    For displaying pop-ups.
  - **Button:**  
    For user interaction.

- **Framer Motion:**  
  Adds fluid animations, enhancing the user experience on button hover and click.

- **React Router DOM:**  
  Enables routing, used for creating custom "404 page not found".

- **Responsive Design:**  
  Images and layout adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across mobile and desktop views.

- **Vite:**  
  Used as the bundler for fast builds and optimized development workflow.
