# News Paper Signup Challenge

This folder contains the implementation for the **News Paper Signup** challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). The challenge focuses on building a simple signup page while handling both client-side and server-side errors.

## Technologies & Tools

### **Frontend**
- **HTML:**  
  Provides the structure and semantic foundation of the page.
- **Tailwind CSS:**  
  Utilized for styling with a utility-first approach.
- **React & JavaScript:**  
  React is used as the core framework for building the component-based UI.
- **React Hook Form:**  
  Handles form validation and state management efficiently.
- **Redux & Redux Thunk:**  
  - Redux manages application state effectively.
  - Redux Thunk is implemented to handle API calls asynchronously.
- **Apollo Client:**  
  Used to communicate with the GraphQL backend.

### **Backend**
- **GraphQL:**  
  The backend is built using GraphQL, with a randomized response that returns either success or failure, designed to test server-side error handling.

### **Deployment**
- **Vercel:**  
  The backend is hosted on Vercel.
- **GitHub Pages:**  
  The frontend is deployed via GitHub Pages.

## Demo

Below is a side-by-side preview of the component in both mobile and desktop views:
