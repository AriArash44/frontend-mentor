# Contact Form Component Challenge

This folder contains the implementation for the **Contact Form Challenge** from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). The objective was to build an accessible, responsive form component with real-time validation and user feedback.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Vue 3**  
  The foundation of the component logic and reactivity.

- **TypeScript**  
  Ensures type safety, clearer interfaces, and better DX.

- **Tailwind CSS**  
  Utility-first CSS framework for consistent styling.

- **Vanilla CSS**  
  Used to complement Tailwind where finer control was needed.

- **Toastify JS**  
  Lightweight toast notification library for success messages.

- **Lodash (`throttle`)**  
  Throttles the toast notification on form submission to prevent spam.

- **GitHub Pages (`gh-pages`)**  
  Used for deploying the live version of the project.
